## Purpose:

1. To serve as a useful tool for myself.
2. To improve my Python skills.
3. To improve my object-oriented design and architecture skills.
4. To learn unit testing and TDD.

## The idea:
<p>
  Often, while at work or working on something at home, I want to write down a useful tip or a link to a website that solves a problem I have that I may want to refer to again some day. I like to use simple text files for this because they are super fast to open, edit, and save. The problem is that these files start to pile up, or get lost across different folders. I also had no easy way of searching for the file I want. The Windows file explorer is just too slow and hard to use. 
  I envisioned this tool to serve as a hub for creating, modifying, and retrieving these text files. You can create one with a click of a button, add your content, perhaps add a keyword or two, and then save it. You can then find it again by searching for part of its title, or by filtering all files by topic or keyword.
